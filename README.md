# Next.js 15 Middleware Header Propagation Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where changes made to request headers via middleware might not immediately be reflected in subsequent asynchronous operations within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using `async/await`.

## Bug Description

When middleware modifies request headers (e.g., setting authorization tokens), those changes might not be immediately available to `fetch` calls or other asynchronous operations executed within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the middleware's effects are properly propagated to subsequent requests. This might involve using a different approach for managing authentication, such as environment variables or a more robust mechanism for passing authentication information.
